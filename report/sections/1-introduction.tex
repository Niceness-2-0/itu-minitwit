\section{Introduction}
This report includes a description of the architecture and implementation details of the ITU-MiniTwit system developed as part of the DevOps course at the IT University of Copenhagen. 

%The ITU-MiniTwit project is a microblogging service designed as part of the DevOps course. It is a simplified version of Twitter where users can register, follow others, and post short messages ("tweets"). 

%The project provides a foundation to apply and demonstrate modern DevOps practices such as continuous integration and delivery, containerization, automated testing, infrastructure as code, monitoring, scalability, and teamwork practices. In order to apply these practices and to help us test the robustness and scalability of the system, we have been provided a simulator that generates realistic user behavior.

Together, these following sections aim to provide a comprehensive view of our development process and the resulting system.

Throughout the term, our team incrementally developed and improved the system, focusing on different aspects in development.
