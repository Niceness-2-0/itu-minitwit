\section{Concluding Remarks}
%Also reflect and describe what was the "DevOps" style of your work. For example, what did you do differently to previous development projects and how did it work?

%we can talk about devops cycle and how we followed it every week?

In this project, we followed a DevOps type approach. This meant we werenâ€™t just writing code, but also constantly thinking on how the system was built, deployed, and maintained. Compared to previous projects, we focused more on automating the work flow from code to production with CI/CD pipelines, instead of having it as a back thought.
